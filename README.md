# Modelling-housing-price-using-Machine-Learning
In this project I am interested in modelling housing price using Random Forest and K-mean clustering. My final model reached R^2 as 0.78 on Training set and 0.73 on Validation set. This proposed that no sign of overfitting being found and the model is able to predict 73% of the training data.
